### Hi there 

I'm Liam, a middle school student working in computer science as a hobby. I'm currently expanding in Python and HTML, I've worked with Lua in the past. I'm currently learning full stack web development, and working in Batch from time to time.

#### Most of my projects are just for contributors, so no PRs accepted, but are still open sourced and allow issues.
