### Hi there 

I'm Liam, I work in computer science as a hobby. I'm currently expanding in Python and HTML for web development, I've worked with Lua in the past. I'm also working in Batch & JavaScript from time to time.

#### Project Priorities 
* STEM Project (Web App)
* Batch Scripts
* Input String Bot

#### Most of my projects are just for picked contributors, so no PRs accepted, but are still open sourced and allow issues. Also I have mininal contributions because most repo's I don't need get deleted and not archived
